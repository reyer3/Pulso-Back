# Files removed in Step 1.3
## Removed unified_transformer.py - Complex async/sync mixing causing pipeline hangs
## Removed business_logic_transformer.py - asyncio.run() conflicts in running event loops

These files have been eliminated to resolve the hanging issue described in the logs.
The new simplified architecture is: Extract → RawTransformer → Load → MartBuilder
